# Who wants to be a millionaire

This is my custom project of a popular TV show. Project isn't yet finished, but I am going to update it regularly.

The aim of the project is to demonstrate understanding of issues:
* simple JavaFX implementation,
* testing with JUnit (given/when/then, paramterized Tests, tests with Mockito),
* classes, interfaces,
* collections, access restrictions etc.

The logic of the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire was applied to it.
