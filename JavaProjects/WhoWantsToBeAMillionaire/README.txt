This is my custom project of a popular TV show. Project isn't yet finished, but I am going to update it regularly.

The aim of the project is to demonstrate understanding of issues, e.g. in the field of collections, access restrictions, creating classes, interfaces and interaction with the user (player).

The logic of the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire was applied to it.
