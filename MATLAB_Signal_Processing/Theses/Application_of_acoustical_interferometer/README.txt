The engineering thesis was aimed at building a laboratory stand for non-contact measurement of displacements and vibrations using ultrasonic waves.

Signal Processing:
Algorithms for measuring displacements using a pulse and a continuous sine wave are presented here (signal_processing_impulse.m and signal_processing_sin.m files). To measure the vibration velocity, an algorithm was implemented using the wave demodulation methodology based on the Hilbert transform (file vibr_vel_measurement.m).

Displacements:
As part of the work, appropriate laboratory stands were built, consisting of ultrasonic transducers with air coupling, a linear drive, a vibration exciter, a generator and a signal acquisition card. Software for data acquisition and processing has been implemented. Displacement tests were carried out using impulse and sinusoidal excitation. The collected information was processed and the result was compared with a reference signal to determine the errors of both methods.

Vibration velocity:
The station was rebuilt, replacing the translation platform with an exciter ended with a glass plate. Research was carried out on the vibration of this plate. A number of measurements were made by changing the amplitude or frequency of the vibrations.
In the first case, a linear dependence of the described quantities was found, while in the second, due to the improper operation of the inductor, the results seemed inconclusive. A proposal for further work was presented, in which it is recommended to perform tests using a laser vibrometer in order to validate and calibrate ultrasonic measurements.
