Tools were generated to develop directional characteristics of transducers.

The characteristics of the interdigital transducers for the aluminum plate were analyzed and the legitimacy of their use in this case was confirmed.

The results of creating these characteristics for a composite panel are also presented. They turned out to be worse in quality, so corrections were proposed that could lead to their improvement.

It was also possible to plot fragments of dispersion curves, more precisely: mode A0 for a composite plate. On their basis, it was noticed that the speed of wave propagation does not depend on the direction of its propagation in a given medium. An exemplary speed of propagation of this wave mode for one of the excitation frequencies is also shown. Unfortunately, the resonance of the transducer made it impossible to plot more curves.
