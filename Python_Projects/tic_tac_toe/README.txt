The project was created to show intermediate level python programming skills.

It implements the main file (tic_tac_toe.py) in which Player class objects are created. Checking for a possible win and catching exceptions (including those custom defined in the TTTExceptions.py file) is carried out in the GameLogic.py file. Additionally, a file was created to test various game results (TTTTests.py).
